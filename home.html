                    Bharatanatyam is the oldest classical Indian dance form and is often regarded as the Mother of other dance forms. This dance style began in Tamil Nadu, India, then spread throughout South India. Originally a solo dance performaed only by women, this dance illustrates Hindhu religious themes and spiritual ideas using intricate footwork and expressions.

                    The name of Bharatanatyam is derived from two Sanskrit words: 'bharata' and 'natyam'. Natyam means dance. Bharata is a mnemonic including 'bha', 'ra', and 'ta.' Ba means bhava(emotion and feelings). Ra means raga(melody). Ta means tala (rhythm). All three are expressed in Bharatanatyam.

                    The base of Bharatanatyam comes from the ancient Hindhu and Sanskrit text called the Natya Shastra, first completed between 200 BCE to 200 CE. This was written by Indian musicologist Bharata Muni. Lord Brahma, the Hindhu god of creation, revealed Bharatanatyam and the art of performing to Bharata Muni who then encoded it in the Natya Shastra. The text consists of thousands of verses structured in different chapters. Contents of the text include standing postures, basic steps, bhava, rasa, methods of acting, and gestures.

                    Lord Shiva is the Hindhu god of dance and Parvati devi is his wife. Another important text is the Abhinaya Darpana, believed to be written by Nandikeshwaram. It is a detailed text explaining mudras(hand gestures), body movements, and other gestures. Bharatanatyam began as an offering to the gods, being only performed in temples. It is known for its rigid movement and strenous footwork. It relies heavily on technique, body movement, facial expressions, and mudras.

                    Abhinaya is the Sanskrit word for facial expressions, the way the dancer communicates or expresses. Rasas are different moods a dancer can exhibit. According to the Natya Shastra, Bharatanatyam can be divided and classified into three major categories:

                    <li class = "dancetypes">Nritta: Movement of the body without facial expressions, with a focus on rhythem.</li>
                    <li class = "dancetypes">Natya: Dance that involves mainly expressions, dialogues along with music and dance, used for storytelling. </li>
                    <li class = "dancetypes">Nrithya: This is a combination of the above two, including both extensive footwork and storytelling. </li>

                    Born in the Hindhu temples of Tamil Nadu, Bharatanatyam prospered in South India due to the Devdasi culture, dating back to 300 BCE to 300 CE. Devadasis were temple dancers who danced to please and serve the Lord. Deva means deity and dasi means servant. Girls at a young age were dedicated to the temple and often considered married to the deity. A ceremony called pottukattal commemorated this.

                <p> 
                    Devadasis were often called nitya sumangali(eternally married and freed from widowhood). Then she started training in dance under dance teachers known as Nattuvanurs or koothiliars. They were the gurus who passed on their knowledge for generations. These dancers were seen in high regard and had a high social position. After years of training, a dancer was ready to perform their arangetram, their first official performance, held in the dance halls of temple complexes. Bharatanatyam was an important part of ritual worship.

                    However, soon Bharatanatyam lost its credibility once it started being performed for entertainment rather than for the gods. The dance was patronized by kings and high members of society, and moved to the palace courts. Courtesan dancing occured during the Nayaka period of Tamil Nadu, around the late 16th or 17th century.

                    During British and Mughal rule, their position worsened. Classical dance forms were subjected to ridicule and discouragement. Devadasis' social and economic conditions added to the degredation of Bharatanatyam. They faced harsh treatment and despicable attitudes from Christian missionairies and British officials. The British called the Devadasis prostitutes and thus disgraced the ancient culture. In 1829, Christian missionaries launched an anti-dance movement, and the Madras Presidency under British colonial rule banned the custom of dancing in Hindhu temples in 1910.

                    A revival movement began in resistance to these new measures. People like E. Krishna Iyer and Rukmini Devi Arundale were prominent in reviving Bharatanatyam. They worked hard to bring Bharatanatyam back to the high esteem is was at previously. They wanted to bring back the focus to bhakti (love for God) rather than for entertainment purposes. A new dance style was formed in this effort. In this way, Bharatanatyam is a prominent dance form not just in India but also across the world thanks to the efforts of these revivalists. Bharatanatyam is also beneficiaal for blood circulation in the body and keeps muscles in shape.
