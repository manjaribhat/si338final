                    Whenever there is a Bharatanatyam performance, the dancer is usually accompanied by an orchestra. The orchestra is always comprised of a singer, mrdanga (indian drum to give the beat), flute and/or violin, or veena. Several other South Indian percussion instruments can also be used like the ghatam, kanjeera, tambura, moorsing, nadaswaram, and harmonium. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The guru conducts the whole performance by saying beats out loud and playing the nattuvangam, small Indian cymbals. The dancer then has to dance in time with the orchestra using complex beats.

                    Before beginning to learn a Bharatanatyam repertoire, a student must learn adavus. Adavus are the basic steps which include a combination of the position of the legs, standing posture, hand gestures, and walking movements. This helps gain control of body movements and understand rhythem and speed better. A student must also learn over fifty five root mudras (hand gestures), used to narrate the performance. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    A full margam (repertoire) of a Bharatanatyam performance typically consists of Alaripu, Jatheswaram, Shabdham, Varnam, Padam, and Thillana. Other dances added on include Pushpanjali, Keerthanam, Javali, and Mangalam.

                    An arangetram is the first official solo performance done by a dancer. They have to complete the entire margam with minimal breaks, testing their stamina. A dancer is ready for this once their guru deems so, after years of training. I completed my arangetram in 2022!

                    When performing as a group, intricate choreos are done and requires synchronization. Nowadays, there is more of a shift to group performances.
