        <h2>The Different Styles of Bharatanatyam</h2>
        <div class = "styles">
            <p>
                Bharatanatyam includes many styles each with its own distinct characteristics which are called Banis. There are classified into specific Gharanas(schools). All these styles follow the same basic structure outlined in the Natya Shastra and the Abhinaya Darpana. Variations appeared due to different gurus and teachers modifying the art form to their needs. These styles spread throughout India, then eventually out of India. Three main, popular forms in the beginning were Vazhavoor, Pandanallur, and Tanjuvoor. Due to opposition from the Mughals and British, the three main popular styles became Tanjavoor, Pandanallur, and Kalakshetra. All follow the same general rules.

                    <p> 
                        The Vazhavoor Style of Bharatanatyam is characterized with vibrant dressing, and gentle, natural expressions throughout the dance. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        There are many static postures, elegant leaps, and smoother, slower stpes. It's rare to have any abrupt movements. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        The focus of the Vazhavoor style is on feminine aspects of dance. It includes many expressions of romantic love. Although many people still practice this style of Bharatanatyam, it isn't as popular as it used to be due to much opposition.

                <h3>Tanjavoor Style</h3>

                        <img src = "../images/melattur-style.jpg" alt = "Two performing Bharatanatyam dancers, one standing with leg raised to the arm and other on her knees">

                        An old name for the Tanjavoor style of Bharatanatyam is Melattur. This style of dance comes from the court of rulers of Tanjavur. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        This style gives equal importance to abhinaya and nritta. It includes a lot of older devadasi traditions. There is more of a focus on romantic expressions and gestures than a sole focus of love for God. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        There is more stress given on variations of different beats and dramatic characterization. Importance is given to the ability to do spontaneous movements and accurate jathis, series of footwork.

                        The Pandanallur Style of Bharatanatyam is based off of linear geometry and focuses on precise movements. It is known for its subtle movements, gentle and clear footwork.

                    <p> 
                        It includes many deep sitting positions, and it has rather slow and rhythmic movements compared to other styles. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        The abhinaya(expressions) in this dance form is mainly ritualistic, done according to certain rules set by ancient texts.

                        The Kalakshetra style of Bharatanatyam is a newer style, founded by Rukmini Devi Arundale who was originally trained in the Pandanallur style. 
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        This style has a focus on bhakti, love for the Lord, and devotion towards him. This style has become very popular and spread throughout much of India and the world even though it's so new.
